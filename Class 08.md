# More CSS and structuring elements
 - CSS treats each HTML elemetn as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
 - *Block level elements* start on a new line: h1, p, ul, and li are all examples of this.
 - *Inline elements* Flow in between surrounding text
- If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element, then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.


## Controlling Element Position
 - CSS has **positioning schemes** that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning and absolute positioning. You specify the sceheme using the *position* property in CSS. You can also float elements using the *float* property.

 - To indicate where a box shoudl be positioned, you may also need to use *box offset* properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.
 - When you move any element from normal flow, boxes have a possibility of overlapping. the *z-index* property allows you to control which box appears on top.
 - Pages can be fixed width or liquid layouts.
 - You can include multiple CSS files in one page.s
 ## Design styles
  - Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.
  - Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Typically this uses percentages.

## CSS Frameworks
 - Aim to make the developers life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages etc. 
 - One of the most popular uses of CSS Frameworks is in creating grids to layout pages.
