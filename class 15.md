# What Google learned trying to build the perfect team
 - Google, along with the team members who participated in the project, learned that the framework for a perfect team is essentially cohesion. Each member of the team needs to almost *synergize* with one another and have a unified understanding of what their goal is and what they can do AS A TEAM to reach that goal. It also meant understanding that each person on the team was a human being and not just a work bot meant to put out results. Effective leadership was another common notation from this reading. Having a team lead who understands the requirements of the project and how that translates to working not only with the team but *for* the team as well.
