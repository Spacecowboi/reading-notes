# Notes on Lists, Boxes, Decisions, and loops

### Lists
 - Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. (a recipe, for example)
 - Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
 - Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms
 - **Lists can be nested inside one another**

### Boxes (everything is in a box)
 - The most popular way to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Pixels tend to be the most popular because they allow designers to accurately control their size.
 - **Border**: Every box has a border, even if it is not visible. It separates the edge of one box from another.
 - **Margin**: Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of the margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
 - **Padding**: Padding is the space between the border of a box aand any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its content.
 - If you specify a width for the box, then the borders, margin, and padding are added to its width and height.
 - CSS is what allows the user to control the dimensions of a box.
 - It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
 - Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing the text and the leading.

### JS Decisions & Loops
 - The if...else statement checks a condition. If it resolves to 'true', the first code block is executed. If the condition resolves to 'false', the second code block is run instead.
 - statements inside an if statement should be followed by a semicolon, but there is no need to place one after the closing curly brace of the code blocks.
 - A *switch* statement starts with a variable called the *switch value*. Each case indiciates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
 - Truthy and Falsy: *Falsy* values are treated as *if* they are false. These values can be treated as the number 0. *Truthy* values are treated as *if* they are true. Almost everything that is not falsy can be treated as if it were true.
 - Additionally, the presence of an object or an array is usually considered to be truthy as well.
