### Links in HTML
 - Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one page to another. It is the very coreof what it means to "browse" and "surf" the internet.
 - Links are created using the (a) element. Users can click on anything between the opening tag and the closing tag.
 - Relative URLs can be used when linking pages within your own webiste. 
 
 ### More CSS Notes
  - CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a **block-level** box or an **inline** box.
  - If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the *containing* or *parent* element.
  - There are three positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of the page: **normal flow**, **relative positioning**, and **absolute positioning**.
  - Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
  - Fixed width layout designs do not change sizes as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
  - Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
  - Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
  - You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

  ## Functions!!
   - Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.
   - Pieces of information passed to a function are known as *parameters*
   - When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a *return value*.
   - To create a function, you have to give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a function declaration.
   - To call or *invoke* a function, use ()
   - A function declaration creates a function that you can call later in your code. 
   - A function with no name is known as an *anonymous function*.
   - If you create a variable *outside* of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script. This is known as a **global** variable and has a **global scope**.
